"""Write down which of a block's gaps are closed, so its standing count is
derived instead of typed.

Same job as `make_closed.py` does for the records block, and the same three
states:

  killed      a mutation taken from this sweep's output now fails a test
  equivalent  the mutation is real and the program is the same either way
  superseded  the line the verdict belongs to no longer exists, because a fix
              replaced it

    python build/mutation/make_closed_folder.py core

Line numbers are the sweep's own — for the core block, Hermod `e592b5e7`.
